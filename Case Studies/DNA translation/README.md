# DNA Sequence Translation
DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence â€“ the order of nucleotides in DNA. 
#### Each nucleotide triplet corresponds to an amino acid code in the DNA. 
We are going to decode these nucleotide triplets to give the sequence of amino acid (proteins), and also verify the sequence
with the original file.
### Source for DNA sequence:
DNA sequence and protein sequence files are dowloaded from NCBI site: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/256418990/
#### NCBI reference sequence: NM_207618.2
Also check the CDS number of the DNA sequence you download.
